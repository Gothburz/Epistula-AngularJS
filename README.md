# Epistula -AngularJS

A simple contact form, built with Bootstrap with using AngularJS validation, submission with PHP. I used Angular form css classes and tied them to boostrap form classes giving the user realtime updated form information. Currently has requirements for name and email address fields. Feel free to use and modify to fit your own projects!
